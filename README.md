# Virtue Flash Price

A very simple Front that calculates the Market Price (in USD) of Virtue Stablecoin (vUSD), in this way we can visualize what an "external Market Price" would be (something similar to what we find in CoinMarketCap).
The price is calculated from 4 pools of DEXs (2 from ShimmerSea and 2 from Pools).
